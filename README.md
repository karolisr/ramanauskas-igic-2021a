# RNase-based Self-incompatibility in Cacti

- The directory `kakapo_cfg_to_use_with_assembled_transcripts` contains kakapo configuration files and reference input sequences to extract T2-RNases, F-boxes, Elongation-factor-1-alpha, Alpha-tubulin, and Actin transcripts from a transcriptome assembly or sequence reads (FASTQ or SRA). SRA accessions are available here [PRJNA705387](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/study/?acc=PRJNA705387).

- The `rnase-alignment-tree` directory contains the alignment and scripts required to build T2-RNase gene tree. The best ML tree is also provided.

- The `fbox-alignment-tree` directory contains the alignment and scripts required to build a gene tree for the F-box domain-containing proteins. The best ML tree is provided as well.

- The `tip_data.xlsx` file contains metadata for the T2-RNases and F-boxes. The `tip_data_t2.csv` and `tip_data_fb.csv` files contain the same data in a comma-separated format.
